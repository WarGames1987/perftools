# TODO Some users might prefer filtering only connections to a set of databases, such as:
#
#   AND datname = 'dbXX'
#
# This would best be done as an additional command line option to this program, since
# it's not necessarily the same as the database to connect to, especially when connecting
# as a database superuser for monitoring.
